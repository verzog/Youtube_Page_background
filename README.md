# Youtube_Page_background
A filter to add a youtube video background to your course
This works well in many modern themes (bootstrap 3 and 4?) but due to the vast number used I'm leaving it up to you to check.

To use simple drag the Youtube_Page_background.txt (aka bundle) onto the green bundle button when making a new Generico filter. 

To use in the course:
Enter the atto editor (label, description etc)
click the generico icon and select the "Youtube_Page_background" button
where it says "W0LHTWG-UmQ" you need to paste in the embed code from the youtube URL. e.g. W0LHTWG-UmQ
